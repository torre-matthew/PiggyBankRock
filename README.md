I built this app as I was looking for a fun way to give my six year old some practice counting money.

The game presents a certain amount of money positioned as money in the kids piggy bank currently. 

They have to count the money and select to buy the one toy that matches the amount of money in the piggy bank.

Every correct answer earns a point. Every incorrect answer also earns a point. After 3 incorrect answers, the game restarts.

Game is over when there are 12 correct answers.
