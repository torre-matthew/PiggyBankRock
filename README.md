# Piggy Bank Rock!

### I love technology. I love education. I love the idea of technology enhancing learning, especially for the the K-6 grade years.
### My 6 year old daughter excelled in her first grade math and arithmetic curriculum but I noticed she had no idea how to count money.
### For my first foray into learning React, I decided to build a game that my little girl (or any little girl or boy) could play to help her practice counting money.
